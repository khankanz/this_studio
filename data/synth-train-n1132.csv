RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Recommend continued annual screening mammography in 12 months. 
2. Please inform the patient that her breast tissue is dense. Dense breast tissue is very common and is not abnormal. However, dense breast tissue can make it harder to find cancer on a mammogram and may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information is given to raise awareness and to encourage discussion between the patient and her physician regarding the presence of other risk factors, in addition to dense breast tissue. A report of the results was sent to the patient's physician. The patient may also wish to discuss this information with her physician.

520,"RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND
Clinical History: Increased density in right breast on screening mammogram performed on 01/03/2025. Patient also reports a palpable lump in the right breast in the 3:00 position.
Comparison: None
Technique: Real-time sonography of the right breast was performed using a high-frequency linear-array transducer. Targeted imaging of the palpable lump in the right breast was performed, as well as evaluation of the area of increased density seen on the recent mammogram
Findings:
The palpable lump in the right breast in the 3:00 position correlates to a benign-appearing, circumscribed, oval, hypoechoic mass measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm (TRV x AP x CC). This demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement. This was palpable and mobile with transducer pressure. These findings are consistent with a fibroadenoma. The area of increased density seen on the recent mammogram correlates to a region of overlapping normal fibroglandular tissue. No suspicious masses are identified sonographically. No abnormal axillary lymph nodes are identified.

Date of Exam: 2024-07-06

Clinical History:
Screening breast ultrasound for new microcalcifications seen on recent mammogram. Patient is asymptomatic.

Comparison: Mammogram performed on 06/28/2024.

Findings:
Left Breast: No suspicious masses, calcifications, or other abnormalities are seen in the left breast.
Right Breast: Correlating with the mammographic finding in the right breast at 3 o'clock, approximately 2 cm from the nipple, there is a small, ill-defined area of hypoechogenicity measuring approximately 7 mm in greatest dimension. This area corresponds to the cluster of microcalcifications seen on mammography. No distinct mass is identified. There is minimal vascularity within this area on color Doppler imaging. No associated ductal dilation is seen.

Impression:
The ultrasound findings in the right breast are consistent with the mammographically detected microcalcifications. Although no distinct mass is identified, the presence of the ill-defined hypoechoic area raises some concern.

Clinical History:
Patient referred for breast ultrasound evaluation due to suspicious calcifications identified on screening mammography.

Comparison: Mammogram dated 06/13/2024.

Findings:
Left breast: No distinct masses or other suspicious abnormalities are identified in the left breast.
Right breast: In the right breast, at the location of the suspicious calcifications seen on mammography (3 o'clock position, approximately 2 cm from the nipple), there is a small, ill-defined area of hypoechogenicity measuring approximately 6 mm in greatest dimension. This area corresponds to the cluster of calcifications. No distinct mass is visualized. There is no associated ductal dilation.

Impression:
The ultrasound findings in the right breast are consistent with the mammographically detected calcifications. The presence of the ill-defined hypoechoic area is of uncertain significance and could represent a small focus of malignancy. Given the concerning mammographic features, biopsy is recommended for definitive diagnosis.

Recommendations:

Findings:
Left breast: No distinct masses or other suspicious abnormalities are identified in the left breast.

FINDINGS:

Right breast: The screening mammography images of the right breast demonstrate a small focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant posteriorly, measuring 7 mm.

Dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to detect cancers in the breast by mammography because it can hide small abnormalities. Dense breast tissue may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information is being provided to raise your awareness of the impact of breast density on cancer detection.

848,"BILATERAL SCREENING MAMMOGRAM

INDICATION: Annual screening mammogram.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS:
The breasts are heterogeneously dense (BI-RADS density c), which may obscure detection of small masses.

There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density bilaterally.

A new cluster of amorphous microcalcifications is noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast at the 10 o'clock position, 6 cm from the nipple. This cluster measures approximately 8 mm in greatest dimension. No associated mass, architectural distortion, or skin thickening is identified.

The left breast demonstrates no suspicious masses, calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion.

No mammographic evidence of malignancy is seen in the left breast.

IMPRESSION:
BI-RADS Category 0: Incomplete, additional imaging evaluation needed for the right breast. A magnification view of the right breast is recommended for further characterization of the microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant.

BI-RADS Category 1: Negative for the left breast.

ADDENDUM:
Right breast magnification views demonstrate a cluster of amorphous microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant, measuring approximately 9 mm in greatest dimension. The distribution is clustered and the morphology is suspicious for malignancy. Stereotactic core biopsy is recommended for tissue diagnosis.
